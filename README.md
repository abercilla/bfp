This repository includes code for two reports I worked on as Regional Data Lead for the Florida for Biden data team. 

"MyC Pipeline" was a Google Sheets report that measured the effectiveness of our field team's recruitment efforts in the last week. I wrote SQL code on Civis Analytics' platform to retrieve data from the Florida voter file and then used Civis' functionality to have the output automatically exported to the Google Sheet report every week.

"GOTV Reporter" was a Google Sheets report that took in soft data from our field team via Google Forms. The only hard data we included was number of volunteers scheduled every day, also retrieved via Civis Analytics and set to automatically export every morning.
