This repository includes code for reports I worked on as Regional Data Lead for the Florida for Biden data team.

"GOTV Reporter" was a Google Sheets report that reflected the work our field team completed every shift time. We wrote a SQL query on Civis Analytics' platform that retrieved a metric, "number of volunteers scheduled for that day", from our volunteer recruitment platform, NGP VAN, and the output was automatically exported in the report every morning.
